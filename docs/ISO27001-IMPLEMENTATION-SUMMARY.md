## Recommendations | ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≠‡πÅ‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏≥

### Priority 1 (Critical) üî¥

1. **Obtain E-KYC Provider Documentation Immediately**:
   - Contact Appman to request ISO 27001 certificate, PDPA compliance docs, DPA, quarterly reports
   - This is **CRITICAL** for audit success

2. **Complete Mandatory ISO 27001 Documents**:
   - Information Security Policy (CEO signature required)
   - Risk Assessment (use template, get CEO approval)
   - Risk Treatment Plan
   - Internal Audit (hire auditor if needed)
   - Management Review (schedule with CEO)

3. **Develop Supplier Security Policy**:
   - Use A.5.19-5.22 documentation as basis
   - Get CEO approval

### Priority 2 (High) üü†

4. **Complete Evidence Collection**:
   - Create all evidence folders per audit checklist
   - Collect existing evidence (logs, configs, reports)
   - Generate missing evidence (training, audits, reviews)

5. **Implement High-Risk Controls**:
   - Address R-001 (Biometric breach): Request Appman pen test reports
   - Address R-002 (E-KYC outage): Pre-qualify backup provider

6. **Conduct Mock Audit**:
   - Hire external consultant
   - Identify gaps before formal audit

### Priority 3 (Medium) üü°

7. **Complete Remaining Annex A Documentation**:
   - A.6, A.7, A.8 control implementation guides

8. **Develop Remaining Policies and Procedures**:
   - Use templates if available
   - Tailor to Certogo's context

9. **CISO Assistant Integration** (Optional):
   - Consider using CISO Assistant for tracking compliance
   - Automate evidence collection where possible

## Timeline to Certification | ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏π‡πà‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏á

**Estimated Timeline**: 6-12 months from now

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| **Month 1** | Obtain E-KYC provider docs, complete mandatory policies, conduct internal audit |
| **Month 2** | Complete risk assessment, collect evidence, close internal audit NCs |
| **Month 3** | Conduct management review, address high risks, develop remaining policies |
| **Month 4-5** | Complete all Annex A documentation, collect all evidence |
| **Month 6** | Mock audit, close all gaps |
| **Month 7** | Self-assessment (target: ‚â•90%), apply to CB |
| **Month 8** | Stage 1 audit (document review) |
| **Month 9** | Address Stage 1 findings |
| **Month 10** | Stage 2 audit (on-site/virtual implementation review) |
| **Month 11** | Submit CAPs (if any NCs), close findings |
| **Month 12** | **Certificate Issued!** üèÜ |

**Factors that can accelerate**:
- Appman already provides quarterly security reports ‚Üí no need to wait 12 months
- Internal audit completed quickly
- Dedicated ISMS team

**Factors that can delay**:
- E-KYC provider documentation not readily available
- High number of internal audit NCs
- Management review delayed
- Major gaps found in mock audit
