## 8. Dependencies and Critical Success Factors | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏û‡∏∂‡πà‡∏á‡∏û‡∏≤‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏à‡∏à‡∏±‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≠‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏™‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏£‡πá‡∏à

### 8.1 Dependencies | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏û‡∏∂‡πà‡∏á‡∏û‡∏≤

**Critical Dependencies** that could impact ISMS effectiveness:

1. **üî¥ E-KYC Provider (Appman) Availability**:
   - If E-KYC provider is unavailable, identity verification fails
   - Impact: B2C users cannot complete E-KYC verification for regulated training
   - Mitigation: SLA monitoring (99% availability), incident escalation procedures, **provider change capability** (20-week migration)

2. **Cloud Infrastructure Provider Availability**:
   - If cloud provider has outage, LMS platform is unavailable
   - Impact: Business disruption for all customers
   - Mitigation: Multi-AZ deployment, disaster recovery site (Singapore), RTO < 4 hours

3. **Internet Connectivity**:
   - Cloud-based platform requires internet access
   - Impact: Users cannot access LMS during internet outage
   - Mitigation: Cloud provider guarantees (99.99% network uptime), multiple ISPs

4. **Third-Party Security Posture**:
   - If E-KYC provider or cloud provider is breached, Certogo customer data may be compromised
   - Impact: PDPA violations, reputational damage, customer churn
   - Mitigation: Supplier security assessments (ISO 27001 certification required), quarterly reviews, cyber insurance

### 8.2 Critical Success Factors | ‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏à‡∏à‡∏±‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≠‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏™‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏£‡πá‡∏à

**Factors essential for ISMS success**:

1. **Executive Commitment**:
   - CEO approval of ISMS policy and resource allocation
   - CISO empowered to enforce security controls
   - DPO supported in PDPA compliance activities

2. **Employee Awareness**:
   - 100% completion of security awareness training (annually)
   - **PDPA and biometric data handling training** for roles with PII access üî¥
   - Culture of security (report incidents, follow policies)

3. **Adequate Resources**:
   - Sufficient budget for security tools (SIEM, EDR, encryption)
   - Adequate staffing (CISO, security team, DPO)
   - Time allocated for security activities (risk assessments, audits, training)

4. **Supplier Cooperation**:
   - E-KYC provider (Appman) complies with DPA requirements üî¥
   - Cloud provider maintains ISO 27001 certification
   - Timely incident notification from suppliers (24-hour SLA)

5. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Internal audits conducted (quarterly focused, annually comprehensive)
   - Management reviews (annually minimum)
   - Corrective actions implemented promptly (Critical: 7 days, High: 30 days, Medium: 90 days)
