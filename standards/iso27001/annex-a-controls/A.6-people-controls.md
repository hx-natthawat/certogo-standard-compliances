**Step 1**: **Incident Discovery and Reporting**
- Security incident discovered (via SIEM alert, audit log, manager report, etc.)
- Incident reported to CISO
- Initial assessment: Is it a security policy violation?

**Step 2**: **Investigation**
- CISO (or delegate) investigates
- Collect evidence:
  - Log files (access logs, SIEM alerts)
  - Screenshots
  - Witness statements
  - Device forensics (if needed)
- Interview employee (with HR present)
- **Employee has right to explain** their actions

**Step 3**: **Severity Determination**
- CISO + HR determine severity level (1-4)
- Consider:
  - Intent (accidental vs. malicious)
  - Impact (was data compromised?)
  - Repetition (first offense vs. repeat)

**Step 4**: **Disciplinary Action**
- Apply consequence per severity level
- Document in employee file
- **For Level 3 & 4**: CEO approval required

**Step 5**: **Communication to Employee**
- HR communicates decision in writing
- Specify:
  - What policy was violated
  - Evidence
  - Consequence
  - Corrective actions required (e.g., training)
  - Right to appeal (within 7 days)

**Step 6**: **Appeal Process** (if employee disagrees)
- Employee can submit written appeal to HR Director
- HR Director + independent party (e.g., external lawyer) review
- Decision within 14 days
- Final decision is binding

**Step 7**: **Follow-Up**
- Monitor employee to ensure no repeat
- If termination: Exit procedures (see A.6.5)

- **Immediate Action**:
  - Suspend access to all systems immediately
  - Notify DPO and legal team
  - **PDPA notification**: Assess if data breach notification required (to authorities and data subjects)
  - Forensic investigation to determine scope
- **Consequence**: Termination + possible legal action

**Scenario 2**: Employee leaks biometric data to unauthorized party
- **Severity**: Level 4 (Critical)
- **Immediate Action**:
  - All of Scenario 1 above
  - **Plus**: Report to Thai PDPC (Personal Data Protection Commission) within 72 hours
  - Notify affected customers
  - Engage legal counsel for potential criminal charges
- **Consequence**: Termination + **criminal prosecution** (PDPA Section 41 - up to 6 months imprisonment)

**Scenario 3**: Developer inadvertently logs biometric data (data minimization violation)
- **Severity**: Level 2 or 3 (depending on intent and scope)
- **Immediate Action**:
  - Purge logs containing biometric data
  - Fix code to prevent future logging
  - Conduct code review
- **Consequence**: Written warning (if unintentional, first offense) OR Suspension (if negligent)
