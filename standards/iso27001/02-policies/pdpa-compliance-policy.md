### 1.1 Purpose | ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏ñ‡∏∏‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå

This policy establishes Certogo's framework for compliance with the **Personal Data Protection Act B.E. 2562 (2019)** ("PDPA"), Thailand's comprehensive data privacy law. Given that Certogo processes **highly sensitive biometric data** through E-KYC integration, PDPA compliance is not just a legal requirement‚Äîit is critical to maintaining customer trust and avoiding severe penalties (up to 5% of annual revenue).

This policy ensures that:
- Personal Data is collected, used, and disclosed lawfully and fairly
- **Biometric data** (PDPA Section 26 sensitive data) receives the highest level of protection üî¥
- Data subjects' rights are respected and facilitated
- Third-party data processors (E-KYC providers) comply with PDPA requirements
- Certogo maintains accountability and transparency in data processing activities

## 11. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏ú‡∏•‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ó‡∏ö‡∏î‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏°‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏π‡∏• üî¥

### 11.1 When DPIA is Required (PDPA Section 37/1)

DPIA is mandatory BEFORE processing that is "likely to result in high risk to rights and freedoms", such as:
- **Sensitive Personal Data processing** (biometric data) üî¥
- Large-scale systematic monitoring
- Automated decision-making with legal/significant effects
- Processing of vulnerable individuals' data (children, elderly)

### 11.2 Certogo DPIA Scenarios

**MANDATORY DPIA**:
1. **E-KYC Biometric Data Processing** üî¥ (already conducted)
2. **New E-KYC provider onboarding** (before switching from Appman)
3. **New feature using biometric data** (e.g., facial recognition for course access)
4. **Profiling or automated decision-making** (if implemented)

**OPTIONAL DPIA** (recommended):
- Major system architecture changes (new cloud provider)
- Large-scale marketing campaigns (bulk PII processing)

### 11.3 DPIA Process

**Step 1: Describe Processing Activity**:
- What: E-KYC identity verification using facial recognition and ID card OCR
- Why: Verify user identity for compliance training (regulated industries require verified identity)
- How: User uploads ID card image and selfie ‚Üí Appman processes ‚Üí Returns Pass/Fail
- Data: Biometric data (facial image, ID card scan), ID card number, name

**Step 2: Assess Necessity and Proportionality**:
- Is processing necessary for the purpose? Yes (identity verification requires biometric comparison)
- Is there a less intrusive alternative? No (manual verification is less secure and scalable)

**Step 3: Identify Risks**:
- **Risk 1**: Biometric data breach at E-KYC provider
  - Likelihood: Low (Appman is ISO 27001 certified, encrypted storage)
  - Impact: Critical (PDPA Section 26 violation, reputational damage, PDPC fines)
  - Risk Level: High

- **Risk 2**: Unauthorized use of biometric data (purpose creep)
  - Likelihood: Low (contractual purpose limitation with Appman)
  - Impact: High (PDPA violation, loss of trust)
  - Risk Level: Medium

- **Risk 3**: Biometric data retention beyond 30 days
  - Likelihood: Low (automated deletion, quarterly audits)
  - Impact: High (PDPA Section 26 violation)
  - Risk Level: Medium

**Step 4: Identify Mitigation Measures**:
- **For Risk 1** (Breach):
  - Appman ISO 27001 certified
  - DPA with security requirements (encryption, access control, breach notification)
  - Quarterly security reviews
  - Cyber insurance (covers third-party breaches)

- **For Risk 2** (Unauthorized Use):
  - DPA with purpose limitation clause
  - Annual review of Appman's data usage (audit logs)
  - No sub-processors without Certogo's approval

- **For Risk 3** (Retention):
  - Automated deletion after 30 days (contractual requirement)
  - Quarterly verification (certificate of deletion requested)
  - DPO audit of Appman's deletion logs

**Step 5: Residual Risk Assessment**:
- Risk 1: High ‚Üí Medium (after mitigations)
- Risk 2: Medium ‚Üí Low
- Risk 3: Medium ‚Üí Low

**Step 6: Decision**:
- ‚úÖ Proceed with processing (residual risks acceptable)
- ‚ùå Do not proceed (risks too high, even after mitigations) - N/A

**Step 7: Approval**:
- DPO prepares DPIA report
- CEO reviews and approves
- If high residual risk remains, may consult PDPC (optional, not mandatory in Thailand PDPA)

**Step 8: Documentation**:
- DPIA report filed in `/evidence/records/dpia/`
- Reviewed annually or upon significant changes

**DPIA Template**: Available at `/standards/iso27001/06-templates/dpia-template.md` (to be created)
