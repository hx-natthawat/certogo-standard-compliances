### 7.1 Detection Sources | ‡πÅ‡∏´‡∏•‡πà‡∏á‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏à‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ö

Incidents may be detected from:

1. **Automated Monitoring**:
   - SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) alerts
   - IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention) alerts
   - AWS CloudWatch alarms
   - Application logs (failed logins, API errors)
   - E-KYC API monitoring üîÑ

2. **Manual Reporting**:
   - Employee reports (suspicious emails, unusual system behavior)
   - Customer complaints (unauthorized access to accounts)
   - **E-KYC provider notification** üîÑ (Appman reports breach)
   - External security researchers (vulnerability disclosure)
   - Regulatory notification (PDPC informs Certogo of breach)

3. **Third-Party Notifications**:
   - Cloud provider (AWS) security alerts
   - Antivirus/EDR vendor alerts
   - Threat intelligence feeds

## 8. Initial Assessment and Triage | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏ô

### 8.1 Assessment Checklist | ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏à‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ô

**IRT Lead (CISO)** conducts initial assessment within **15 minutes** (CRITICAL) or **1 hour** (HIGH):

#### Step 1: Confirm Incident Validity
- [ ] **Is this a real incident** or false positive?
- [ ] Review detection source (SIEM logs, user report)
- [ ] Check for similar past events (was this previously classified as benign?)

**If FALSE POSITIVE**:
- Close incident log with reason: "False positive - [explanation]"
- Update detection rules to reduce future false positives
- END

**If REAL INCIDENT**:
- Continue to Step 2

#### Step 2: Classify Incident Severity
Use decision tree from Section 4.3:

- [ ] **Does it involve biometric data?** üî¥
  - YES ‚Üí **CRITICAL** (CAT-02) ‚Üí **Immediate CISO + DPO notification**
  - NO ‚Üí Continue

- [ ] **Does it involve personal data breach?**
  - YES ‚Üí Count affected users:
    - ‚â•1,000 ‚Üí **CRITICAL** (CAT-01)
    - 100-999 ‚Üí **HIGH** (CAT-01)
    - <100 ‚Üí **MEDIUM** (CAT-01)
  - NO ‚Üí Continue

- [ ] **Is production system compromised?**
  - YES ‚Üí **HIGH** or **CRITICAL** (CAT-03)
  - NO ‚Üí Continue

- [ ] **Is service unavailable or degraded?**
  - Complete outage ‚Üí **CRITICAL** (CAT-04)
  - >50% degradation ‚Üí **HIGH** (CAT-04)
  - 10-50% degradation ‚Üí **MEDIUM** (CAT-04)
  - <10% degradation ‚Üí **LOW** (CAT-04)

#### Step 3: Assemble IRT
Based on severity:

**CRITICAL** üî¥:
- ‚úÖ CISO (IRT Lead)
- ‚úÖ DPO
- ‚úÖ IT Security Manager
- ‚úÖ DevOps Lead
- ‚úÖ Legal Counsel
- ‚úÖ CEO (within 30 minutes)
- ‚úÖ External Forensics (if data breach)

**HIGH** üü†:
- ‚úÖ CISO (IRT Lead)
- ‚úÖ IT Security Manager
- ‚úÖ DevOps Lead
- ‚è≥ DPO (if data breach)
- ‚è≥ Legal Counsel (if compliance issue)

**MEDIUM** üü°:
- ‚úÖ IT Security Manager (IRT Lead)
- ‚úÖ DevOps Lead (if infrastructure issue)

**LOW** üü¢:
- ‚úÖ IT Security Analyst (handles alone, escalates if needed)

#### Step 4: Establish Communication Channel
- [ ] Create **dedicated Slack channel**: `#incident-[INC-ID]` (e.g., `#incident-2024-01-15-001`)
- [ ] Invite all IRT members
- [ ] **Set channel to PRIVATE** (prevent information leakage)
- [ ] Pin incident log link to channel

#### Step 5: Initial Containment Decision
- [ ] **Should affected systems be isolated immediately?**
  - CRITICAL biometric breach üî¥ ‚Üí **YES** (isolate E-KYC API immediately)
  - Active ransomware ‚Üí **YES** (disconnect infected systems from network)
  - Suspected data exfiltration ‚Üí **YES** (block external connections)
  - Failed login attempts ‚Üí **NO** (continue monitoring, implement IP block)

**If immediate containment required**:
- Execute **Short-Term Containment** (Section 9.1)
- Then continue to full response

---

### 8.2 PDPA Breach Assessment (for Data Breaches) üî¥

**If incident involves personal data breach**, DPO immediately assesses:

#### Question 1: Is this a PDPA-reportable breach?

**PDPA Section 37 requires notification to PDPC if breach is likely to affect data subjects' rights and freedoms.**

**Reportable** ‚úÖ:
- Biometric data breach (any number of users) üî¥
- Personal data breach affecting ‚â•100 users
- Breach involving sensitive data (health, religion, political opinion)
- Breach likely to cause financial harm (credit card data)

**Not Reportable** ‚ùå:
- <10 users affected with non-sensitive data
- Data encrypted with no key compromise
- Internal unauthorized access with no exfiltration (containment successful)

#### Question 2: What is the notification timeline?

**PDPC Notification**: **Within 72 hours** of becoming aware of breach üî¥

**Data Subject Notification**: "Without delay" (interpret as **within 7 days**)

**Countdown Starts**: When Certogo becomes aware (not when breach occurred)

**Example Timeline**:
```
Day 0, 14:00: Breach detected ‚Üí Countdown starts ‚è∞
Day 0, 17:00: PDPC notification drafted (53 hours remaining)
Day 1, 10:00: CEO approves PDPC notification (33 hours remaining)
Day 1, 14:00: PDPC notification sent ‚úÖ (48 hours elapsed, 24 hours buffer)
Day 5: Data subject notification sent ‚úÖ (5 days elapsed)
```

## 9. Containment | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏ï‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå

### 9.1 Short-Term Containment | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ô

**Goal**: **Stop the bleeding** - prevent incident from spreading.

**Timeline**: Execute within **1 hour** (CRITICAL), **4 hours** (HIGH).

#### Containment Actions by Incident Type:

##### CAT-01/CAT-02: Data Breach / Biometric Data Breach üî¥

**Actions**:
1. **Isolate compromised systems**:
   - Disconnect affected servers from network (AWS Security Group: block all inbound/outbound)
   - Disable compromised user accounts (suspend all sessions)

2. **Block attacker access**:
   - Block attacker IP addresses at firewall (AWS NACL, WAF)
   - Revoke compromised API keys/tokens

3. **Preserve evidence**:
   - Take EBS snapshot of affected EC2 instances (for forensics)
   - Export database logs (last 30 days) to S3 immutable storage
   - Do NOT shut down systems yet (RAM contents needed for forensics)

4. **Notify E-KYC provider** üîÑ (if biometric data breach at Certogo's side):
   - Email Appman: security@appman.co.th
   - Subject: "URGENT: Potential Biometric Data Breach at Certogo"
   - Ask Appman to check for suspicious API access from Certogo

**Example - E-KYC API Compromise**:
```bash
# Immediate actions (executed by DevOps Lead within 15 minutes):

# 1. Block all traffic to E-KYC integration API
aws ec2 modify-security-group-rules \
  --group-id sg-ekyc-api \
  --security-group-rules SecurityGroupRuleId=sgr-xxx,SecurityGroupRule='{IpProtocol=-1,CidrIpv4=0.0.0.0/0,Description="INCIDENT CONTAINMENT - Block all"}'

# 2. Revoke E-KYC API credentials
# (Coordinate with Appman to rotate OAuth client secret)

# 3. Snapshot affected systems
aws ec2 create-snapshot \
  --volume-id vol-ekyc-api \
  --description "Forensic snapshot - INC-2024-01-15-001"

# 4. Export API access logs (last 30 days)
aws logs create-export-task \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/ekyc-integration \
  --from $(date -d '30 days ago' +%s)000 \
  --to $(date +%s)000 \
  --destination s3://certogo-forensics/INC-2024-01-15-001/
```

##### CAT-03: System Compromise (Malware, Unauthorized Access)

**Actions**:
1. **Isolate infected systems**:
   - Disconnect from network (preserve RAM for forensics)
   - Block lateral movement (firewall rules between VPCs)

2. **Disable compromised accounts**:
   - Suspend user accounts with suspicious activity
   - Force password reset for all users with access to compromised systems

3. **Deploy enhanced monitoring**:
   - Enable VPC Flow Logs (if not already enabled)
   - Increase SIEM log verbosity for affected systems

##### CAT-04: Service Disruption (DDoS, Infrastructure Failure)

**Actions**:
1. **DDoS Mitigation**:
   - Enable AWS Shield Advanced (if not already active)
   - Activate CloudFront rate limiting
   - Contact AWS Support for DDoS Response Team

2. **Infrastructure Failure**:
   - Failover to secondary region (if multi-region setup)
   - Scale up healthy instances (Auto Scaling)

##### CAT-08: Ransomware

**Actions** üî¥:
1. **IMMEDIATE ISOLATION** (within 5 minutes):
   - Shut down infected systems (do NOT attempt to save data)
   - Disconnect backup systems (prevent ransomware from encrypting backups)
   - Block network shares (SMB, NFS)

2. **Do NOT pay ransom** (company policy):
   - Paying does not guarantee data recovery
   - Funding criminal activity
   - Use backups for recovery (PROC-004: Backup Recovery Procedure)

3. **Preserve ransomware sample**:
   - Copy ransomware executable to isolated forensics system
   - Submit to VirusTotal, Malware Analysis Platform

### 9.2 Long-Term Containment | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ß

**Goal**: Maintain business operations while preparing for full eradication.

**Timeline**: Hours to days (depends on incident complexity).

**Actions**:
1. **Deploy temporary workarounds**:
   - Restore service on clean systems (from backups)
   - Route traffic around compromised infrastructure
   - Example: If production database compromised, promote read replica to temporary primary

2. **Implement enhanced monitoring**:
   - Deploy additional SIEM sensors
   - Enable full packet capture for affected network segments
   - Monitor for attacker returning

3. **Plan for eradication**:
   - Identify root cause (vulnerability exploited, compromised credentials)
   - Develop patch/fix strategy
   - Schedule maintenance window for full remediation

---

## 10. Eradication | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏≥‡∏à‡∏±‡∏î‡∏™‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏ï‡∏∏

### 10.1 Root Cause Analysis | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏∞‡∏´‡πå‡∏™‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏ï‡∏∏‡∏´‡∏•‡∏±‡∏Å

**Goal**: Understand **how** the attacker got in and **ensure they can't get back in**.

**Timeline**: **4-24 hours** (CRITICAL incidents).

**5 Whys Technique**:

**Example - Unauthorized Database Access**:
```
Incident: Attacker accessed production database

Why #1: Why did attacker access database?
‚Üí Attacker had valid database credentials

Why #2: Why did attacker have valid credentials?
‚Üí Credentials were leaked in GitHub repository

Why #3: Why were credentials in GitHub repository?
‚Üí Developer committed .env file with production credentials

Why #4: Why did developer commit .env file?
‚Üí No pre-commit hook to prevent committing .env files

Why #5: Why was there no pre-commit hook?
‚Üí Pre-commit hooks not enforced in developer onboarding

ROOT CAUSE: Lack of secure coding training and automated controls
```

**Eradication Actions**:
1. Remove credentials from GitHub (git-secrets scan)
2. Rotate all database credentials
3. Implement pre-commit hooks (prevent .env commits)
4. Add secure coding training to onboarding

---

### 10.2 Eradication Actions by Incident Type

##### CAT-01/CAT-02: Data Breach

**Actions**:
1. **Close attack vector**:
   - Patch vulnerability (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
   - Rotate compromised credentials (API keys, passwords)
   - Fix misconfigured access controls (S3 bucket permissions)

2. **Remove attacker persistence**:
   - Delete unauthorized user accounts
   - Remove backdoors (web shells, malicious cron jobs)
   - Check for residual malware (full antivirus scan)

3. **Verify data integrity**:
   - Compare database with last known good backup
   - Check for unauthorized data modifications
   - Restore from backup if data integrity compromised

##### CAT-03: System Compromise

**Actions**:
1. **Rebuild compromised systems** (recommended over cleaning):
   - Terminate compromised EC2 instances
   - Deploy fresh instances from trusted AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
   - Restore data from clean backups (verify backup integrity first)

2. **Patch vulnerabilities**:
   - Apply OS security updates (Ubuntu, Windows Server)
   - Update application dependencies (npm audit fix, pip update)
   - Harden configurations (disable unused services, change default ports)

3. **Scan for lateral movement**:
   - Check all systems in same VPC/network segment
   - Review access logs for suspicious activity (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs)

##### CAT-08: Ransomware

**Actions**:
1. **Remove ransomware**:
   - Wipe infected systems (do NOT attempt to remove malware manually)
   - Rebuild from clean AMI/image

2. **Decrypt data** (if possible):
   - Check for free decryption tools (No More Ransom project)
   - If no decryption available, restore from backups (PROC-004)

3. **Identify infection vector**:
   - Check for phishing emails (malicious attachments)
   - Review RDP/SSH access logs (brute force attacks)
   - Scan for vulnerable software (unpatched systems)

   - Apply all security patches before reconnecting to network

2. **Reconfigure security controls**:
   - Update firewall rules (block attacker IPs, close unused ports)
   - Enable MFA for all admin accounts (if not already enforced)
   - Rotate all credentials (passwords, API keys, certificates)

3. **Verify system integrity**:
   - Run vulnerability scans (Nessus, OpenVAS)
   - Check for unauthorized changes (file integrity monitoring)
   - Validate application functionality (smoke tests)

**Go/No-Go Checklist** (before restoring service):
- [ ] Root cause identified and fixed
- [ ] All patches applied
- [ ] Credentials rotated
- [ ] Backups verified and tested

‚îú‚îÄ If stable ‚Üí Continue
‚îî‚îÄ If issues ‚Üí Rollback, investigate

Day 2: Restore service for 50% of users
‚îú‚îÄ Monitor for 12 hours
‚îú‚îÄ If stable ‚Üí Continue
‚îî‚îÄ If issues ‚Üí Rollback

Day 3: Restore service for 100% of users
‚îú‚îÄ Monitor for 24 hours
‚îî‚îÄ Declare recovery complete ‚úÖ
```

**Immediate Rollout** (for LOW/MEDIUM incidents):
- Restore service to 100% of users immediately after verification

##### Phase 3: Enhanced Monitoring

**Monitoring Window**: **7 days** after recovery for CRITICAL incidents.

**Monitor for**:
- Attacker returning (same IP, similar attack patterns)
- Residual malware (unusual network traffic, unauthorized processes)
- Data integrity issues (corrupted data, unauthorized modifications)

**SIEM Alerts** (temporarily increase sensitivity):
- Failed login attempts (threshold: 5 ‚Üí 3)
- Database access anomalies (large data exports)
- Network traffic to known malicious IPs

## 13. Special Case: Biometric Data Breach üî¥

### 13.1 Unique Characteristics | ‡∏•‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏©‡∏ì‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏â‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏∞

**Biometric data breaches** are **ALWAYS CRITICAL** üî¥ due to:

1. **PDPA Section 26**: Biometric data = **Sensitive Personal Data**
   - Requires explicit consent (higher bar than regular personal data)
   - Breach penalties: Up to **5 million THB** or **5% of annual revenue**

2. **Irreversibility**: Unlike passwords (can be changed), biometric data is **permanent**
   - Facial features, fingerprints cannot be "reset"
   - Breach has **lifetime impact** on data subjects

3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: PDPC will investigate ALL biometric breaches
   - Mandatory PDPC notification (72 hours) üî¥
   - Likely on-site audit by PDPC
   - Potential criminal charges (PDPA Section 77)

---

### 13.2 Biometric Breach Response Procedure üî¥

**If biometric data breach occurs** (at Certogo or E-KYC provider):

#### Immediate Actions (0-1 hour):

**Step 1: Assemble CRITICAL Incident Team**
- [ ] CISO (IRT Lead)
- [ ] DPO (PDPA compliance lead) üî¥
- [ ] CEO (within 30 minutes)
- [ ] Legal Counsel
- [ ] External Forensics (engage immediately)
- [ ] **E-KYC Provider (Appman)** üîÑ (if breach at Certogo's side)

**Step 2: Determine Breach Location**
- [ ] **Breach at Certogo?**
  - Certogo does NOT store biometric data (see POL-003, Section 4.1)
  - Check: Could breach be of E-KYC verification results (Pass/Fail)? ‚Üí NOT biometric data, treat as CAT-01 (Data Breach)
  - If somehow biometric data found at Certogo ‚Üí **CRITICAL INCIDENT** üî¥, immediate investigation

- [ ] **Breach at E-KYC Provider (Appman)** üîÑ
  - Appman notifies Certogo per DPA (24-hour notification requirement)
  - Certogo becomes Data Controller responsible for PDPC notification

**Step 3: Immediate Containment**
- [ ] **If breach at Certogo**:
  - Isolate all systems with access to E-KYC integration API
  - Revoke E-KYC API credentials (coordinate with Appman)
  - Block all API calls to Appman (AWS Security Group)

- [ ] **If breach at Appman** üîÑ:
  - Request Appman's incident report (within 24 hours per DPA)
  - Demand Appman's containment actions (isolation, credential rotation)
  - Consider **emergency provider switch** (PROC-002, Section 11: Emergency Migration)

#### Timeline-Critical Actions (1-72 hours):

**Hour 2-24: Root Cause Investigation**
- [ ] Engage external forensics firm (for legal evidence quality)
- [ ] Identify number of affected users
- [ ] Identify types of biometric data exposed (facial images, ID cards)
- [ ] Identify attacker (if possible): IP addresses, attack method

**Hour 24-48: PDPC Notification Preparation**
- [ ] DPO drafts PDPC notification (use Appendix B template)
- [ ] CEO reviews and approves
- [ ] Legal Counsel reviews for accuracy

**Hour 48 (Target): PDPC Notification Sent** üî¥
- [ ] Send to PDPC: pdpc@mdes.go.th
- [ ] Subject: "Personal Data Breach Notification - Certogo Co., Ltd."
- [ ] Include: Incident Report (Appendix B), remediation plan, affected user count
- [ ] **MUST be within 72 hours** üî¥

**Hour 48-72: Data Subject Notification Preparation**
- [ ] Draft customer notification email (use Appendix C template)
- [ ] PR team reviews messaging (prevent panic, maintain trust)
- [ ] Customer Success team briefs account managers (for B2B clients)

**Day 3-5: Data Subject Notification** üî¥
- [ ] Email all affected users ("without delay" per PDPA Section 38)
- [ ] Provide: What happened, what data was exposed, what we're doing, what they should do
- [ ] Set up dedicated support hotline for affected users

### 13.3 E-KYC Provider Breach Coordination üîÑ

**If Appman (current E-KYC provider) notifies Certogo of breach:**

#### Certogo's Responsibilities as Data Controller:

**Step 1: Demand Information from Appman** (within 24 hours per DPA):
```
To: security@appman.co.th
Cc: legal@appman.co.th
Subject: URGENT: Information Request - Biometric Data Breach

Dear Appman Security Team,

We have received your breach notification. As Data Controller, we require
the following information within 24 hours (per DPA Clause 8.3):

1. Number of Certogo users affected (provide user IDs)
2. Types of biometric data exposed (facial images, ID cards)
3. Root cause of breach (vulnerability exploited, attacker method)
4. Containment actions taken (timestamp, specific actions)
5. Timeline: When breach occurred vs. when Appman detected
6. Evidence: Forensic report, attacker IP addresses, compromised systems

Failure to provide this information will constitute DPA breach and may
trigger emergency provider migration (PROC-002).

Certogo DPO
[DPO-NAME] / dpo@certogo.com
```

**Step 2: Assess Appman's Response**

**Acceptable Response** ‚úÖ:
- Full transparency (all 6 questions answered)
- Containment completed within 4 hours of Appman's detection
- Root cause identified with remediation plan
- **Appman offers**: Free credit monitoring for affected users (1 year)

**Action**: Proceed with PDPC notification, maintain Appman relationship

**Unacceptable Response** ‚ùå:
- Delayed response (>24 hours)
- Incomplete information (evading questions)
- No remediation plan
- Appman blames Certogo without evidence

**Action**: **Initiate emergency provider migration** (PROC-002, Section 11: 6-10 weeks)

**Step 3: Joint Remediation Plan**

Certogo + Appman collaborate on:
1. **Immediate**: Credential rotation, system hardening
2. **Short-term** (1-4 weeks): Vulnerability patches, security audit
3. **Long-term** (1-3 months): Architecture review, penetration testing

Certogo monitors Appman's progress (weekly status calls until complete).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

**5 Whys**:
1. Why did attacker access database? ‚Üí Attacker had valid credentials
2. Why did attacker have credentials? ‚Üí Credentials leaked on GitHub
3. Why were credentials on GitHub? ‚Üí Developer committed .env file
4. Why did developer commit .env? ‚Üí No pre-commit hook to prevent it
5. Why no pre-commit hook? ‚Üí Not part of developer onboarding

**ROOT CAUSE**: Lack of automated controls to prevent credential leakage + insufficient security training.

**Contributing Factors**:
- No secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- GitHub repository was public (should be private)
- Database credentials not rotated regularly (credential was 6 months old)

---

**Users Affected**:
- **Number**: 0 users (no data breach, containment successful)
- **Categories**: N/A

**Data Affected**:
