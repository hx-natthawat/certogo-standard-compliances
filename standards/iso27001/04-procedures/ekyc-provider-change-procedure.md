## 1. Purpose | ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏ñ‡∏∏‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå

This procedure defines the process for **changing the E-KYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) service provider** that processes **biometric data** (facial images, ID card scans) on behalf of Certogo.

**Why This Procedure is Critical** üî¥:
- E-KYC provider processes **PDPA Section 26 Sensitive Personal Data** (biometric data)
- Provider change must ensure **zero data loss and zero security incidents**
- Migration must maintain **business continuity** (E-KYC service remains available)
- Biometric data must be **deleted from old provider** (30-day maximum retention)
- **ISO 27001 documentation must be updated** (SoA, policies, risk assessment)

**Current E-KYC Provider**: Appman Co., Ltd.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This procedure is provider-agnostic. It can be used to migrate from any E-KYC provider to any other provider.

| **Repeated SLA failures** | Availability < 95% for 2 consecutive months (contract allows termination) | **30 days** (termination for cause) |
| **Material breach of DPA** | E.g., cross-border data transfer without consent, retention > 30 days | **Immediate** |

### 3.2 Discretionary Triggers üü† (MAY change provider)

| Trigger | Reason | Urgency |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Better alternative available** | New provider offers better accuracy, lower cost, or more features | **90 days** (termination for convenience) |

2. **Monitoring** (Real-time dashboards):
   - **Availability**: New provider uptime vs. old provider
   - **Response time**: New provider < 5 sec (95th percentile)
   - **Accuracy**: Verification Pass/Fail rates (compare to old provider baseline)
   - **Error rate**: API errors (target < 1%)
   - **User complaints**: Customer support tickets related to E-KYC

3. **Daily Review Meeting** (CISO, CTO, Engineering):

---

## 9. PHASE 4: Old Provider Decommissioning (Week 18)

### 9.1 Data Deletion Verification üî¥ (Most Critical Step)

**Actions**:

1. **Request Deletion from Old Provider** (Appman):
   - DPO sends deletion request via email + API (if available):
   ```
   To: security@appman.co.th
   Subject: Biometric Data Deletion Request - Contract Termination

   Dear Appman Security Team,

   Certogo has migrated to a new E-KYC provider as of [Date]. Per our
   Data Processing Agreement (DPA) Section 10, we request deletion of
   ALL biometric data for ALL Certogo users within 30 days.

   Please confirm deletion and provide:
   1. Certificate of deletion (signed by Appman security manager)
   2. Audit log summary (number of records deleted, deletion date)

   Due date: [Date + 30 days]

   Best regards,
   [DPO Name]
   Data Protection Officer
   Certogo Co., Ltd.
   privacy@certogo.com
   ```

2. **Follow-Up**:
   - Day 7: If no response, send reminder email
   - Day 14: If no response, escalate to CEO (contact Appman CEO)
   - Day 21: If no response, legal demand letter (DPA breach)

3. **Receive Certificate of Deletion** üî¥:
   - Appman provides certificate: "All biometric data for Certogo users has been deleted on YYYY-MM-DD. Total records deleted: [Number]. Signed: [Appman Security Manager]."
   - DPO files certificate in `/evidence/records/data-deletion-certificates/appman-termination-deletion-[YYYY-MM-DD].pdf`

4. **Verification**:
   - DPO conducts final audit of Appman (if audit rights allow)
   - Or request third-party attestation

**SLA**: Certificate received within **30 days** of request (per DPA)

**CRITICAL** üî¥: Failure to obtain certificate = PDPA violation risk. If not received, legal action may be required.

---

## 11. Emergency Migration (Fast-Track)

**Scenario**: Mandatory trigger (e.g., Appman data breach, loss of ISO 27001 cert) requires immediate migration.

**Timeline**: **6-10 weeks** (compressed from 20 weeks)

**Changes**:
- **Accelerate provider selection** (2 weeks instead of 4): Use pre-qualified providers from shortlist
- **Parallel planning and integration** (concurrent instead of sequential)
- **Higher risk tolerance**: 50% traffic immediately (skip 10% phase)
- **Expedited contracts**: Use template DPA (minimal negotiation)

**Risks**:
- Less thorough testing (may have bugs in production)
- Higher stress on team
- Potential service disruptions

**Mitigation**:
- Dedicated team (full-time for 6-10 weeks)
- External consultants (if needed)
- Enhanced monitoring (24/7 during migration)

---

## 12. Rollback Procedure | ‡∏Ç‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏¢‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏±‡∏ö

**Triggers**:
- Critical incident at new provider (data breach, prolonged outage)
- Unacceptable performance (< 95% availability, > 10 sec response time)
- PDPA violation discovered

**Procedure**:
1. **Immediate**: Revert traffic routing to old provider (100%)
2. **Within 1 hour**: Notify CEO, CISO, DPO, CTO
3. **Within 4 hours**: Root cause analysis (what went wrong?)
4. **Within 24 hours**: Decision - Fix and retry, or abandon migration
5. **Within 7 days**: If abandoning, terminate new provider contract, extend old provider contract

**Communications**:
- Internal: Email to all employees (explain rollback, no customer impact)
- External: If customers noticed issues, apologize and explain (service restored)

---

### 14.1 Procedure Review | ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ó‡∏ö‡∏ó‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏≠‡∏ô

**Frequency**:
- **After each provider change** (update based on lessons learned)
- **Annually** (review even if no change, ensure still relevant)

**Owner**: CISO proposes updates, CEO approves

### 14.2 Provider Change Readiness | ‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏û‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£

**Maintain Readiness**:
- Keep shortlist of 2-3 qualified E-KYC providers (update annually)
- Keep DPA template current (update if PDPA regulations change)
- Keep integration code modular (easy to swap providers)
- Conduct tabletop exercise every 2 years (simulate provider change)

**Benefit**: If forced to change quickly (emergency), readiness shortens timeline
